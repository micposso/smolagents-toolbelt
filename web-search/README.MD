# SmolAgents Toolbelt

A curated collection of practical, lightweight agents built using [`smolagents`](https://github.com/smol-ai/smol-agents) and the OpenAI API.

This repo is a hands-on toolbelt of example agents that demonstrate reasoning, tool usage, multi-agent collaboration, and real-world integrations using minimal code. Each agent serves as a composable blueprint for your own LLM-powered applications.
